coppeliasim command line arguments: 
-h: runs CoppeliaSim in headless mode (i.e. without any GUI)

-sXXX: automatically start the simulation. 
    with XXX represents an optional simulation time in milliseconds after which simulation should stop again.

-q: automatically quits CoppeliaSim after the first simulation run ended.

-gREMOTEAPISERVERSERVICE_PORT_DEBUG_PREENABLESYNC: the argument can be used to request 
    a continuous legacy remote API server service to be started at CoppeliaSim start-up. 
    For that to happen, replace in above string following:
PORT is the port number
DEBUG is the debug mode (set to TRUE or FALSE)
PREENABLESYNC allows to preenable the synchronous mode (set to TRUE or FALSE)

-XXX.ttt: loads a CoppeliaSim scene.
-XXX.ttm: loads a CoppeliaSim model.
-XXX.brs: loads an XReality scene.
-XXX.brm: loads an XReality model.
